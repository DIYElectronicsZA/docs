This will reverse the axis in question:\n\n\n\nEndstops Do Not Work Correctly\n\n\nFirst make sure the axis are all moving in the correct direction. \nNext in Repetier Host send the M119 command in the G-Code command line.\n\n\nNote the response in the text log: \n\n\nWhen the endstops are not pressed they should read as Open\nYou can hold an endstop down and then send M119, it should then read Triggered if it is working properly. If you do not have this response then check that the endstop is plugged into the correct port and that the wiring is not damaged. \nIgnore the Max endstops, we only use the Min endstops. \nAlso check that the X endstop relates to x_min and the same for Y and Z with the M119 command. If not then they are connected to the wrong locations.\n\n\nOne of the Axis Does Not Work\n\n\nThe first thing to try is (with the power off) swap one of the working axis stepper motor drivers with the driver on the axis that doesn't work. Test again, then we will know if the driver is faulty or if there is a different problem.\n\n\nRough Layers in Prints\n\n\nThe attached picture shows how A , C and D layers are very rough and layers \nB are smooth. This seems to occur at the same levels in each of the models \nwe printed.\nSome are worse than others.\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\nGenerally this problem is a function of three variables: \nTemperature too high, try reduce 5 - 10 'C\nFlow rate too high, try reduce 5 - 10% or check that extruder calibration is spot on\nPrint speed is too high, slow down the print a little. \nTry tweak one of those variables at a time and see if you can get it printing smoothly.\nOver and above those factors some filaments can be more prone to this problem than others, try printing in a different colour and see if it helps. \nFinally one of the biggest causes of this problem is related to the nozzle size, slicer and slicer settings. You may see an improvement by using a better slicer like Simplify 3D, using a smaller nozzle size, changing your layer size and adjusting the extrusion width over height factor. The layer height can also play a roll. \n\n\nEssentially it is a case of fine tuning, but once you get it right the prints will come out perfect. \n\n\nPrusa i3 Cable Management\n\n\nCable management on your Prusa i3 kit, or any 3D printer kit, is very important in order to prevent failed prints and other cable related issues. The following guide is intended to assist with cable management on your printer. \n\n\nOn the extruder, gather all cables together just above the X-carriage. Small cable-ties are useful here.\n\n\n\nBring the cables through the frame and down towards the RAMPS board top left corner.\n\n\n\nSecure the extruder wiring to the top left RAMPS mounting screw with a small cable-tie.\n\n\n\nBring the extruder wiring bundle down to the lower left RAMPS mount and secure. Trim the red hot-end heater cable to length and insert into heater screw terminals. Bunch excess thermistor and stepper motor cable under the Arduino board. Connect Thermistor, Extruder Stepper, Hot-End Fan and (optional) Auto-Level Sensor Cables to the RAMPS board and reinstall the RAMPS fan. \n\n\n\nHow to adjust first layer using \"Marlin Baby Stepping\"\n\n\n\n\nStart print \n\n\nUnder \"tune\" in the main menu select \"Babystepping Z\"\n\n\nTurn the dial anti-clockwise to lower the nozzle closer to the print surface \n\n\nYou will have achieved the ideal nozzle position for your first layer once the filament is being lightly squashed against the print surface creating an even bead of extrusion.\n\n\n\n\nThe Heated Bed Struggles to Reach 100'C or More\n\n\nThat's quite normal, we suggest printing ABS at 80-90'C bed temp, we find that is ideal with our aluminium build plate and ABS / Acetone solution. \n\n\nAdditionally it is possible to get to 110'C if you insulate the bottom of the bed. Using an enclosure helps too. \nWe find this is a bit hot for printing directly to the aluminium bed with ABS, rather this bed temp is suitable for print surfaces such as PEI. \n\n\nEditing your G-Code / Start / End G-Code etc\n\n\nG-Code is the language that is used by your printer electronics to control the printer. The slicing program / toolchain such as Slic3r or Simplify3D generates this G-Code automatically and saves it to a text based .gcode file that is then sent to your 3D printer either over a serial connection, SD card or network. \n\n\nCheck out the following link for some tips on setting up the some of the configurable sections of the G-Code generation in order to fine tune your 3D printers operation: \nhttp://wiki.solidoodle.com/setting-and-editing-your-gcode",
