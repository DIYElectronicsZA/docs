# About

With a high quality rigid frame and a build size of 220x220x250 the CR20 has arrived and made an impression.
The CR20 boasts the best features of Crealities Ender and Cr-10 series at a price that won't break the bank.
A unique feature of the CR20 is the new "Flexy-Sheet" which allows makers to pop their prints off the bed easier than before.
Creality is the current leaders in desktop 3D printers and it's clear why.
