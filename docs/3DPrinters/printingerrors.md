#Common print errors

##Print not sticking to the bed

This issue can be a "sticky" one to fix. Not because it is difficult but because this can be attributed to a number of different causes.
Let's jump in to the probable causes:

1.  Your printer may be printing too fast on the first layer, slowing down your print to allow the plastic to bind to the build platform is important.
    If your printer is moving too fast it may be pulling on already laid plastic. </br>

2.  Sometimes your bed may not be level 
    
3. One of the most common causes is nozzle too far from build platform. 
    When printing your plastic needs to be pressed down on the bed and previous layers, if your nozzle is too high your nozzle is just extruding plastic in to air.
    A good rule of thumb is that you should be able to just, just slide a paper between the nozzle and print bed.
